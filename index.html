  <p id="tribute-info">It is about a mercenary, Tyler Rake (Hemsworth) who is initally hired to rescue the wife of an
    abusive crime
    lord and her children from a Georgian prison, but who finds that he must also protect the family from the crime
    syndicate after
    the extraction.

    <h3 id="Story"> Story </h3>
    <p id="paragraph-1">Tyler used to be a special forces soldier with the Australian Army. He chose to go to
      Afghanistan for yet another tour of duty while his son was battling an incurable disease and was not present when
      the boy died. Then his marriage fell apart and he became a mercenary. Guilt over husbandly and parental failure is
      as much of a driving force in the "Extraction" franchise as amnesia in the "Bourne" films and mourning in the
      "John Wick" series. Tyler's adventures are redemption stories, set in action movie purgatories filled with shadow
      versions of the hero: defective fathers who mistreat, neglect, or warp their children and see them as extensions
      of their ego or brand. Tyler's main enemies are dark parents who could be stand-ins for Tyler's own masochistic
      feelings about how badly he failed his family.</p>

    <p><q>Extraction 2</q> Ending Explained: What That Cliffhanger Could Mean For <q>Extraction 3</q>
      <br><br>
      After an intense, hand-to-hand combat showdown between Tyler and Zurab, Tyler finally manages to kill Zurab. (He
      even shoots him in the head, so, yeah, hes dead!) Nik has been gravely injured but ultimately lives. Sandro is
      fine. Its a happy ending. Yay!

      Well, except for the fact that Tyler and Nik are now inmates in a prison in Georgia. Apparently, you cant just
      ruthlessly murder a bunch of people without legal consequences. Those Georgia laws sure are weird. But dont worry,
      they wont be in prison for long. In the very last scene of the movie, Tyler is driven to a remote location with
      none other than Alcott, aka Idris Elba. Where has that guy been this whole time? <br><br>

      After some playful digs about Tylers name, Idris Elba offers to get him out of a prison, and a new job. “Come and
      work for my team,” he says. And yes, Tylers friend/lover/teammate Nik can come too.<br><br>

      What team is that, exactly? Who is Idris Elbas mysterious boss? “A gnarly motherfucker. You ll love him,” Elba
      replies. With that, the movie ends. Extraction 2 leaves it up to you to decide who Elba s boss might be, be it the
      Prime Minister of England or another mafia boss. We just don`t know!<br><br>

      While Extraction 3 has not yet been greenlit, it`s safe to say this ending leaves the door open for another movie.
      As director Sam Hargrave told Decider, “There`s definitely an appetite for a third movie. I know AGBO has spoken
      of it, Netflix has mentioned they`d be excited to do it, and Hemsworth loves playing the character. I definitely
      have a bunch of ideas bouncing around up in this brain of mine.” So stay tuned.
